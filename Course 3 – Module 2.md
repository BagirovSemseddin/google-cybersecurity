# Course 3 – Module 2: Network Security

## What I Learned
- Common network protocols and their role in secure communication
- Wireless networking protocols and associated security considerations
- Network security controls used to protect organizational infrastructure
- Virtual networks and how they support secure system design
- The purpose and use of VPNs for privacy and secure connectivity

## Key Concepts
- Common and auxiliary network protocols
- Wireless protocols and network access control
- Firewalls as a primary network defense mechanism
- Security zones and network segmentation
- Subnetting and CIDR notation
- Proxy servers and traffic mediation
- Virtual networks and privacy
- VPN protocols such as IPsec and WireGuard
- Site-to-site VPN connections

## Why This Matters
- Network security controls reduce the attack surface of an organization
- Firewalls and segmentation limit lateral movement
- VPNs protect data in transit across untrusted networks
- Understanding protocols helps analysts identify abnormal traffic
- Secure network design is essential for protecting sensitive systems

## Reflection
- I learned how network protocols and security controls work together
- This module strengthened my understanding of defense-in-depth at the network level
- I now better understand how secure communication is implemented in real environments
