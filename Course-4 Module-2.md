# Course 4 – Module 2: Linux Fundamentals

## What I Learned
- The architecture of the Linux operating system
- Core components of a Linux system
- Different Linux distributions and their use cases
- Installing software using package managers
- Basic shell concepts and command-line interaction
- Standard input and output handling in the shell

## Key Concepts
- Linux kernel and system components
- Popular Linux distributions (e.g., Kali Linux and others)
- Package managers for software installation
- Shell environments and different shell types
- Command execution and process interaction
- Standard input (stdin), standard output (stdout), and standard error (stderr)

## Practical Exposure
- Installed software on a Linux distribution in a lab environment
- Entered and navigated the shell
- Executed basic commands
- Observed and analyzed command input and output behavior

## Why This Matters
- Many enterprise systems run on Linux
- Security investigations often require command-line analysis
- Understanding shell behavior is essential for log analysis and scripting
- Input/output redirection is critical when analyzing system data
