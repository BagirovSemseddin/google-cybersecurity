# Course 4 – Module 3: Linux commands in the Bash Shell

## What I Learned
- Navigating the Linux file system using Bash
- Creating, modifying, and managing files and directories
- Searching for files using command-line tools
- Filtering output using grep
- Managing file permissions and ownership
- Adding and removing users from the system
- Using sudo and understanding privilege escalation
- Accessing documentation through man pages

## Core Command Categories

### File & Directory Navigation

- cd
- pwd

### File Creation & Management
- touch
- cp
- mv

- chgrp

### User Management

## Practical Exposure
- Created and modified directories and files
- Located files using search commands
- Filtered command output using grep
- Changed file permissions and ownership
- Added and removed users in a controlled lab environment
- Used sudo for privilege-based actions

## Why This Matters
- Many security investigations require direct CLI interaction
- Misconfigured permissions are a common security risk
- User account management is critical in access control
- Privilege escalation attempts often involve abuse of sudo or permissions
- Efficient file searching and filtering speeds up incident response
