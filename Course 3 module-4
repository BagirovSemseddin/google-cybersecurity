# Course 3 – Module 4: System & Network Hardening

## What I Learned
- The principles of security hardening for operating systems and networks
- How brute-force attacks target authentication mechanisms
- Techniques used to strengthen operating systems against exploitation
- Network hardening strategies to reduce attack surfaces
- Cloud security fundamentals and secure configuration practices
- The role of cryptography in protecting data in cloud environments

## Key Concepts
- Operating system hardening (patching, access control, service minimization)
- Brute-force attack mitigation strategies
- Network hardening and segmentation
- Firewall and access control configurations
- Cloud security best practices
- Encryption and secure communication in cloud systems

## Practical Exposure
- Applied operating system hardening techniques in guided activities
- Analyzed brute-force attack behavior
- Evaluated network security configurations
- Reviewed cloud security control strategies

## Why This Matters
- Hardening reduces the attack surface before incidents occur
- Strong configuration prevents privilege escalation and lateral movement
- Cloud environments require secure-by-default configurations
- SOC analysts must understand defensive controls to assess risk impact
