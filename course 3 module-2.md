# Course 3 – Module 3: Network Attacks

## What I Learned
- How denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks impact network availability
- How to analyze network communication at different layers
- How packet sniffing can expose sensitive information
- How IP spoofing is used to disguise malicious activity
- How to read and interpret tcpdump logs

## Key Concepts
- DoS vs DDoS attacks
- Packet capture and traffic inspection
- tcpdump log analysis
- Malicious packet sniffing
- IP spoofing techniques
- Network-layer attack patterns

## Practical Exposure
- Analyzed simulated DDoS attack scenarios
- Reviewed tcpdump output to identify abnormal traffic
- Examined network-layer communication patterns
- Evaluated indicators of spoofed IP addresses

## Why This Matters
- Availability is a core component of the CIA triad
- Network attacks often generate detectable traffic anomalies
- Understanding packet behavior helps identify malicious activity
- SOC analysts must distinguish between high traffic and hostile traffic
