# Course 3 – Module 1: Network Fundamentals

## What I Learned
- Basic network tools and their role in cybersecurity
- The fundamentals of cloud computing and cloud networking
- TCP/IP and OSI models and how data moves through networks
- IP addressing and how devices communicate with each other
- Core concepts of network communication

## Key Concepts
- Network devices and basic networking tools
- Cloud networks and shared infrastructure
- TCP/IP vs OSI model layers
- IP addresses and packet transmission
- How data travels across a network

## Why This Matters
- SOC analysts rely on network knowledge to understand alerts and logs
- Knowing network layers helps identify where attacks occur
- Understanding IP communication is essential for detecting suspicious activity
- Cloud environments are widely used in modern organizations

## Reflection
- Previously, I focused mostly on attacking tools rather than understanding how networks operate
- This module helped me understand the structure behind network communication
- I began thinking about traffic from a defensive (blue team) perspective
