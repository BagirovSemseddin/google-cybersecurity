# Course 4 – Module 1: Operating System Fundamentals

## What I Learned
- The core functions of operating systems
- How applications interact with the operating system
- Process execution flow and system requests
- Resource allocation (CPU, memory, storage)
- Virtualization technology and its purpose
- Differences between GUI and CLI environments
- Basic command-line usage concepts

## Key Concepts
- Operating system as an intermediary between hardware and applications
- Process lifecycle and scheduling
- System calls and resource management
- Virtual machines and hypervisors
- GUI vs CLI operational differences
- Command-line interaction for system control

## Why This Matters
- SOC analysts must understand how processes behave within an OS
- Suspicious activity often appears at the process level
- Resource abuse (CPU, memory) can indicate compromise
- Virtualization is widely used in enterprise environments
- Command-line familiarity is essential for security investigation

## Reflection
This module shifted my focus from using systems to understanding how they operate internally.  
Understanding process flow and resource allocation strengthens my ability to analyze abnormal system behavior.
