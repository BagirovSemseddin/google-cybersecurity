# Course 4 – Module 4: Databases & SQL Fundamentals

## What I Learned
- The purpose and structure of databases
- How SQL is used to query and analyze stored data
- Writing basic and intermediate SQL queries
- Applying filters to narrow down query results
- Comparing Linux filtering (grep) with SQL filtering (WHERE clause)
- Joining multiple tables to correlate related data

## Key Concepts

### Database Fundamentals
- Tables, rows, and columns
- Structured data storage
- Relational database concepts

### Core SQL Queries
- SELECT
- FROM
- WHERE
- ORDER BY
- LIMIT

### Filtering & Operators
- Comparison operators (=, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
- Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)
- Date filtering
- Numeric filtering
- Pattern matching (LIKE)

### Table Joins
- INNER JOIN
- LEFT JOIN
- Comparing join types
- Correlating related datasets

## Practical Exposure
- Executed SQL queries in a lab environment
- Applied filters using WHERE clauses
- Combined multiple conditions with AND / OR / NOT
- Sorted and limited query outputs
- Joined tables to analyze related records

## Why This Matters
- Security investigations often require querying logs stored in databases
- SQL filtering is essential for identifying suspicious patterns
- Correlating multiple tables mirrors real-world log analysis
- Efficient querying reduces investigation time in SOC environments
