# Incident Response Simulation Using NIST Cybersecurity Framework

## Scenario Overview
A simulated security incident involving suspicious network traffic and potential unauthorized access was analyzed.

## Framework Used
NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

The incident response process was structured according to the five core functions:

- Identify
- Protect
- Detect
- Respond
- Recover

## Incident Analysis

### 1. Identify
- Determined affected systems
- Evaluated potential business impact
- Assessed possible attack vectors

### 2. Protect
- Reviewed existing access controls
- Evaluated system hardening measures
- Confirmed security configurations

### 3. Detect
- Analyzed logs and alert indicators
- Identified abnormal traffic patterns
- Correlated suspicious events

### 4. Respond
- Contained affected systems
- Blocked malicious IP addresses
- Documented findings

### 5. Recover
- Verified system integrity
- Confirmed restoration of services
- Reviewed lessons learned

## Key Takeaways
- Structured frameworks improve decision-making during incidents
- Clear documentation reduces confusion
- Risk-based thinking is essential for effective response

## Reflection
Using the NIST framework helped transform a reactive process into a structured analytical workflow.
