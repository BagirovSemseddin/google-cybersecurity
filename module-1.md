# Course 2 – Module 1: Managing Security Risks

## Key Concepts
- Risk, threat, and vulnerability distinctions
- CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
- Security controls vs security frameworks

## Frameworks Introduced
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
- OWASP Top 10
- CISSP domains overview

## Why This Matters
- Security decisions are risk-based, not tool-based
- Frameworks provide a common language across teams
- CIA Triad helps evaluate real business impact

## Reflection
- I previously focused on attacking systems rather than understanding risk
- This module shifted my mindset toward defensive and organizational security
